        "# OpenAI Agents with Couchbase via Model Context Protocol (MCP) - A Tutorial\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to build an intelligent agent using [OpenAI agents framework](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/agents) that can interact with a Couchbase database. The key to this interaction is the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which allows the AI agent to seamlessly connect to and use Couchbase as a tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "## What is the Model Context Protocol (MCP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is an open standard designed to standardize how AI assistants and applications connect to and interact with external data sources, tools, and systems. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that allows AI models to seamlessly access the context they need to produce more relevant, accurate, and actionable responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Goals and Features of MCP:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Standardized Communication:** MCP provides a common language and structure for AI models to communicate with diverse backend systems, replacing the need for numerous custom integrations.\n",
        "*   **Enhanced Context Management:** It helps manage the limited context windows of LLMs efficiently, enabling them to maintain longer, more coherent interactions and leverage historical data.\n",
        "*   **Secure Data Access:** MCP emphasizes secure connections, allowing developers to expose data through MCP servers while maintaining control over their infrastructure.\n",
        "*   **Tool Use and Actionability:** It enables LLMs to not just retrieve information but also to use external tools and trigger actions in other systems.\n",
        "*   **Interoperability:** Fosters an ecosystem where different AI tools, models, and data sources can work together more cohesively.\n",
        "\n",
        "MCP aims to break down data silos, making it easier for AI to integrate with real-world applications and enterprise systems, leading to more powerful and context-aware AI solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**MCP Typically Follows a Client-Server Architecture:**\n",
        "*   **MCP Hosts/Clients:** Applications (like AI assistants, IDEs, or other AI-powered tools) that want to access data or capabilities. In this demo, this notebook, through the OpenAI agents framework, acts as an MCP client.\n",
        "*   **MCP Servers:** Lightweight programs that expose specific data sources or tools (e.g., a database, an API) through the standardized MCP. The `couchbase-mcp-server` project fulfills this role for Couchbase.\n",
